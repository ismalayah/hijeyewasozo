She is a social media star, singer and a YouTuber, who is known best for being a member of the family Eh Bee, which was very active on the now-defunct network Vine and is today active on YouTube and various social media networks. The family is living in Ontario.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=early-life-family-and-education></span>Early life, family and education<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Gabriela is being raised alongside her brother Roberto Burgos, or ‘Mr. Monkey’, by their father Andres Burgos or ‘Papa Bee’ and their mother Rossana Burgos or ‘Mama Bee’ – the family became active on the internet in January 2013, and Gabriela’s parents are also models and businessmen, as they’ve signed contracts with various companies and brands including Johnson & Johnson, Toyota, and Pepsi.</p><p>Gabriela became interested in sports while attending elementary school, and thanks to her parents’ activities on the internet, she became interested in singing and dancing.</p><p>After noticing that she’s talented, her mother enrolled her at a singing school, while Gabriela has also been practicing her acting skills with her school’s drama club.</p><p>She has just recently in 2020 enrolled at a high school, and although she has four more years to go before matriculation, Gabriela has already expressed her desire to attend college.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=career-as-a-social-media-star></span>Career as a social media star<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As the family has described in the bio section of their YouTube channel, their main goal is for parents to watch their videos and learn how to have fun with their children and other halves.</p><p>Their channel, “The Bee Family” was launched on 21 June 2013, and has since gathered well over nine million subscribers, and over 2.5 billion views of all their videos combined. Two of the family’s most popular videos are “GUMMY FOOD vs REAL FOOD!!” which has been viewed over 100 million times since 15 April 2017 and the “FORTNITE DANCE CHALLENGE! – (In Real Life)” which has been watched over 96 million times since 26 April 2018.</p><p>The family is also very active on Facebook, as they are followed by over 1.8 million people, while they’ve uploaded close to 2,000 pictures which have mostly been taken during their everyday lives.</p><p>They are least active on Twitter, but are followed by over 110,000 people, while they have more than 10 million fans on Facebook. Gabriela and the rest of the crew are taking extra care of their TikTok, onto which they upload at least one comedy video each day, and have thus gathered over 5.7 million followers and more than 82 million likes of all their videos and pictures combined.</p><p>Gabriela also has her own channel which she launched on 19 May 2018, and which is today subscribed to by over 1.6 million people, and counts close to 125 million views of all her videos combined – she is mostly focused on uploading her songs, gameplay videos and other random things.</p><p>On Instagram, Gabriela is followed by close to 700,000 people, and has 8,000 followers on Twitter.

She has one best friend who can be seen featured in some of her pictures on Instagram, and who can on rare occasions also be seen featured in her family’s videos.</p><p>As of October 2020, Gabriela is single, hasn’t married and doesn’t have children.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=hobbies-and-other-interests></span>Hobbies and other interests<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Gabriela’s favorite season is winter as she prefers snow over sea, and is an avid skier while she also knows how to snowboard – the family spends at least one week each year high up in the mountains at their favorite ski resort.</p><p>She is keen on tasting various cuisines – her favorite is Italian while her favorite food is pizza.</p><p>Gabriela likes to travel and the family has been to several Canadian cities while they have also been to New York and Florida in the USA and France in Europe.</p><p>In her spare time and occasionally with her family, Gabriela likes to watch movies, and a few of her favorite actors and actresses are Johnny Depp, Will Smith and Natalie Portman, while a few of her favorite movies are the franchise “Pirates of the Caribbean”, “Bad Boys” and “Leon: The Professional”.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=age-and-height></span>Age and height<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Gabriela’s age is 14.
