A combination of the Great Recession, a rise in customers buying on-demand and digital copies of films and the launch of streaming services is what has caused DVD sales to plummet.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=when-did-dvds-go-mainstream></span>When did DVDs go mainstream?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The first players appeared in Japan on November 1, 1996, followed by the United States on <b>March 31, 1997</b>, with distribution limited to only seven major cities for the first six months.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-came-after-vhs-but-before-dvd></span>What came after VHS but before DVD?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>The LaserDisc (LD)</b> is a home video format and the first commercial optical disc storage medium, initially licensed, sold and marketed as MCA DiscoVision (also known simply as “DiscoVision”) in the United States in 1978.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-was-before-vhs></span>What was before VHS?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>There Was <b>Betamax</b>. 1975: Sony introduces the Betamax video recorder.
